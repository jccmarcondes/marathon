# CLI

Executing the CLI version of marathon requires you to provide all the options through the *Marathonfile*. 
By default, it will be searched in the working directory by the name **Marathonfile**, but if you need a custom file path you can specify
 it via the options. Additionally for Android vendor extensions it's possible to provide a custom Android SDK location instead of
 using *ANDROID_HOME* environment variable or providing this via the Marathonfile.

```bash
$ marathon -h
usage: marathon [-h] [--marathonfile MARATHONFILE]
                       [--android-sdk ANDROID_SDK]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                     show this help message and exit

  --marathonfile MARATHONFILE,   marathonfile file path
  -m MARATHONFILE

  --android-sdk ANDROID_SDK      Android sdk location
```

# Gradle plugin

Executing your tests via gradle is done via calling appropriate gradle task, for example *marathonDebugAndroidTest*. These tasks will be
 created for all testing flavors including multi-dimension setup.
 
```bash
$ gradle :app:marathonDebugAndroidTest
```
